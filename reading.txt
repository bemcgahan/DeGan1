I learned that the framebuffer is a main component of the graphics system. The detail of the framebuffer is dependent on the number of pixels in the framebuffer. 

I also learned that sets of verticies and pixels are processed in a similar way so that a pipeline architecture can be used in computer graphics. Data can be processed simultaneously.
